      <p class="p"> Almost every job in the world now has a requirment of learning at least the basics of computer coding.  Realizing this, I am trying to at the very least get a job that I love doing.  My career goal is to be a video game designer.  I plan
      to graduate high school, get a four-year degree at a college, and start looking for videogame companies with open spots for hiring.  I want this job because the the way that just a simple direction of movement in a game requires alot of coding is fascinating to me and I like the art of how to design the graphics of the game.
       </p>
       <p class= "p">I should get the job because i am very outgoing and artistic when it comes to creating characters and enviroments.
       I have proven these traits by participating in my elementary school's yearbook cover competition 3 years in a row.  One of my important achievements last year was to join a game development club.  I have learned from Game Development Club is how to create music files and sprites for characters.
       </p>
       <p class= "p">In conclusion, because of my experiances, I hope you look over this resume and think about it.  Thank you for you're time and Please, feel free to keep browsing around.</p>
