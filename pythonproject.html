    <h1>Hangman</h1>
    <p>
        One of the major problems that we had during programing the game was coding in the dashes.  We overcame this by making an under score for the words instead and attach it to a variable.  Another problem was that the original coding for this program didn't work.  I coded most of the basis of the game, but I failed to connect two guessed letters with each other.  The next day, my partner told me that he scrapped my code entirely and coded a new program over night
